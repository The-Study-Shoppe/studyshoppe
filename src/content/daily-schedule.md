## Here's a glimpse into our day

### Hours

We are open Monday-Thursday, 3:00pm to 5:00pm, on full school days. We follow the Effingham Unit 40 calendar, so if there is a half day or school is closed, The Study Shoppe is closed.

### Schedule

#### 3:00 - 3:15

Welcome students, all students will be required to use hand sanitizer (provided), backpacks sprayed with disinfection spray, and students escorted to seat. 

#### 3:20

Students will be called up individually, to Concession Stand for purchases and/or pick up free water bottle. While students are waiting, they will need to fill out agenda with what was done in class and assignments. Next, login to Google Classroom to check assignments. Then, login to Infinite Campus to check grades, making sure no incomplete assignments.

#### 3:15 - 5:00

Quiet study time. Staff is available to help with homework. After homework is completed, students are asked to read for 20 minutes. Additional skills may be practiced based on needs of the student. 

#### 5:00

All students are picked up.
